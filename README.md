# FPL
FPLStatsMan mini-league stats calculator:

This was my first project on the web and was a great learning experience for me but recently I have found myself with less spare time to update the extension and improve features for users. 

I have decided to allow others contribute in the hope that the extension may continue to develop.

Possible areas to focus on:

- Debugging, particularly after FPL updates it's site as this can crash the extesion.
- Improve code, I am a novice coder annd would love to see my work be improved so that I can learn and grow as a developer.
- Add new features: Anything that is useful to an FPL manager is up for consideration. Grahps, visuals etc. would be where I would like to see the extension go next but that is just an idea.
