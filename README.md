With less spare time, I have found it difficult to devote work to this extension and so I have decided to allow others contribute in the hope that the extension may continue to develop.

Possible areas users might like to contribute to:

- Debugging: Whenever FPL changes its site, our extension, particularly the regex expressions, become vulnerable to crashing.

- Improve code: I am a novice coder and am certain my work could be improved by more experienced developers.

- Add new features: Anything that is useful to an FPL manager is up for consideration. Grahps, visuals etc. would be where I would like to see the extension go next but that is just an idea.
